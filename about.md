We're a small software and consulting company working with news organizations to tell better stories and reach new communities through journalism.


Homicide Watch
--------------

In Sept. 2010, we founded Homicide Watch DC, a site dedicated to covering every murder in the District of Columbia, from crime to conviction. The site earned a dedicated, vibrant and engaged audience, as well as awards.

The site uses a custom platform, combining blogging and rich data, that allows reporters to find and tell stories other news outlets miss.

The Homicide Watch framework is available as a hosted platform, licensed exclusively to our partners in their media markets.

Data Journalism
---------------

We believe in data. We are explainers and visualizers. We work with clients to build interactive stories that let users go deep into the underlying reporting.

Newsroom strategy and product development
-----------------------------------------

We started in newspapers. We lived abroad. We learned and moved, and when we started out on our own, we started to see news differently.

Working with partners, we help craft beats and find better ways to cover core subjects.
