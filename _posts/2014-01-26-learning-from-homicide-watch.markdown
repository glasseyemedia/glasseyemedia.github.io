 Great news: Laura and Chris Amico, the team behind the smart, award-winning – revolutionary – Homicide Watch site, are branching out into a new area. And they’re bringing the notions of [structured journalism](http://structureofnews.wordpress.com/structured-journalism/) with them. ... I’m sure Laura and Chris will be just as successful with [Learning Lab](http://learninglab.wbur.org) – not just with creating structures that serve their audience better, but using those structures to do better reporting. Which will help [serve their audience](http://structureofnews.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/whats-news/) even better. Now that’s a virtuous cycle.
