As we live through the data-driven transformation of journalism, we should never assume that information is impersonal or unbiased, or unaffected by editorial decisions, both big and little. (In an inexplicable design choice, the Post decided “brown = bad” on its map.) The Amicos haven’t just shown us how to do better reporting for civically vital issues, at lower cost, and greater benefit. They’ve shown us that even reporting the facts has to be thought of as a political act. They’ve shown us how the choices of journalists and editors continue to matter, even in an age of big data and real-time feeds. For all the neutral style and straight-ahead presentation, the Amicos’ greatest gift, as people inventing a new model of journalism, turns out to be their sense of humanity.
